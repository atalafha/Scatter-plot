# Scatter-plot
# Interactive Scatter Plot using Shiny

Explore the `mtcars` dataset interactively by plotting any two variables against each other.

## Overview

This Shiny application allows users to select variables from the `mtcars` dataset for both the x-axis and y-axis to produce a scatter plot. Users can dynamically change the variables and see how different attributes of cars compare with each other.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menus**: Choose variables for both the x-axis and y-axis dynamically.
- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: The scatter plot updates in real-time as you change the input variables.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have R and the Shiny package installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the app using R or RStudio:
```R
library(shiny)
runApp('https://github.com/talafha90/Scatter-plot.git')
``` 
## Data Source

The app uses the mtcars dataset from the datasets package in R. This dataset provides various measurements for 32 cars from the 1970s.
